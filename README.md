Quantum-Enhanced Sustainable Security Incident Handling in IoT


As Internet of Things (IoT) environments play an increasingly relevant role in various fields, such as healthcare, energy supply and industrial automation, the risk of cyber vulnerabilities and attacks also increases. 

In response to these challenges, the fundamental role of the Information Security Management System (ISMS) in protecting critical information assets is highlighted. Risk management plays a crucial role in this system, since in the presence of a cybersecurity incident scenario and possible response alternatives, they are responsible for re-establishing the system in an appropriate manner. 

To do that, they have to evaluate what is the best response. The time to implement a course of action must be considered, as the time in which the ISMS is restored is a critical aspect. However, in an environmental consciousness world, the sustainability dimension should also be considered, choosing more sustainable responses.

This work represents a significant evolution in risk management and incident response, aligning security practices with broader objectives of sustainability and corporate responsibility. It proposes a method for managing cybersecurity incidents that takes into account response time and the sustainability dimension. The method allows to choose whether we want to favor response time, sustainability or both in a given percentage, and based on that, it selects the most appropriate courses of action to restore the security of the system. This method is implemented using a quantum approach that ensures adequate and consistent response times, regardless of the number of incidents. Finally, this proposal is applied to real cases using our framework, MARISMA, demonstrating its effectiveness and relevance in the current context of risk management.
