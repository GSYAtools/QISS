## Quantum-Enhanced Sustainable Security Incident Handling in IoT


## Introduction

In the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT), the increased integration of cyber-physical systems across critical sectors has amplified exposure to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This article introduces a novel approach for security incident management that combines response rapidity with environmental sustainability using quantum computing techniques.
